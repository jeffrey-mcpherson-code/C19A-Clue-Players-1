For our created FileInitTests.java file, we created tests for a leftward-facing doorway to the Wine Cellar, a rightward-facing doorway to the Cigar Bar, an upward-facing doorway to the Spa, and a downward-facing doorway to the Art Gallery. We also implemented tests to check that a given cell is a standard cell of Wine Cellar, that a given cell is the label cell for Theater, that a given cell is the center cell for Art Gallery, and that a given cell is a secret passage from the Wine Cellar to the Cigar Bar.
